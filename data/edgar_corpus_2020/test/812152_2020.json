  "section_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nRidgefield Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Ridgefield” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated as a Colorado corporation on October 13, 1983 under the name Ozo Diversified, Inc. On June 23, 2006, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada that effected the merger between the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of Nevada (\"RAC-NV\"), pursuant to the Articles of Merger, whereby RAC-NV was the surviving corporation. The merger changed the domicile of the Company from the State of Colorado to the State of Nevada. Furthermore, as a result of the Articles of Merger the Company is authorized to issue 35,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share.\nOn March 9, 1999, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to JOT Automation, Inc. (the \"JOT Transaction\"). As a result of the JOT Transaction, the Company's historical business, with operations primarily involving a depaneling and routing businesses, was considered to be a \"discontinued operation\" and, consequently, provides no benefit to persons seeking to understand the Company's financial condition or results of operations. Following the JOT Transaction, the Company devoted its efforts to the development of a prototype micro-robotic device (the \"micro-robotic device\") to manipulate organic tissues on an extremely small scale. Due to the inability to complete the micro-robotic device, the Company determined that it would cease the development of the micro-robotic device and, as of June 30, 2000, the capitalized costs related to the patent underlying the micro-robotic device were written off by the Company.\nOn March 19, 2002, the Company was awarded United States Patent No. US 6,358,749 B1 for the \"Automated System for Chromosome Microdissection and Method of Using Same\" (the \"Patent\"). During the first quarter of 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company for the purposes of owning, developing and exploiting the Patent. On March 3, 2003, the Company filed Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to form Bio-Medical Automation, Inc., a Nevada corporation wholly-owned by the Company (\"Bio-Medical\" or the \"Subsidiary\"). In May 2003, the Company transferred the Patent to the Subsidiary in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Subsidiary. The Company never derived any revenues from the Patent.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Bio-Medical had 35,000,000 shares of capital stock authorized for issuance consisting of (1) 30,000,000 shares of common stock par value $.001 per share; and (2) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock par value $.01 per share. Bio-Medical has 1,140,773 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, all of which are owned by the Company. Bio-Medical has no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding. A copy of the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws of Bio-Medical are attached to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the year ended December 31, 2005 as Exhibit 3.6 and Exhibit 3.7, respectively, and such documents are incorporated herein by reference.\nSince July 2000, the Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters relating to the timely filing of periodic reports as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company is a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Act. Accordingly, during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 we earned no revenues.\nOur principal executive office is located at 3250 Retail Drive, Suite 120-518, Carson City, NV 89706-0686, and the telephone number is (805) 484-8855. Our website address is www.ridgefieldacquisition.com. None of the information on our website is part of this Form 10-K.\nAcquisition Strategy\nOur plan of operation is to arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement, our objective will be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company's shareholders. We have not identified a viable operating entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement, and there can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.\nWe anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will be a complex process and will involve a number of risks, because potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development. Due in part to economic conditions in a number of geographic areas, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking either the limited additional capital which the Company will have or the benefits of a publicly traded corporation, or both. The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and other factors.\nIn many cases, management of the Company will have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the shareholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by the Board of Directors to seek the shareholders' advice and consent, or because of a requirement of state law to do so.\nThe Company may need additional funds in order to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.\nCompetition\nIn connection with its Acquisition Strategy, the Company expects to encounter intense competition from other entities having business objectives similar to those of the Company. Many of these entities, including SPACs, venture capital firms, blind pool companies, large industrial and financial institutions, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, are well-established and have extensive experience in connection with identifying and effecting acquisitions directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to compete successfully with such entities. The Company's financial resources will be limited in comparison to those of many of its competitors. The Company's limited financial resources may compel the Company to select certain less attractive acquisition prospects.\nEmployees\nAs of March 3, 2021, the Company had 1 employee, Steven N. Bronson, who serves as the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer but takes no salary. The Company does not have any employees that are represented by a union or other collective bargaining group.\nITEM 1A.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nThe Company's common stock is quoted on the Pink tier of the OTC Markets Group under the symbol \"RDGA\". The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low closing bid prices of our common stock as reported by the OTC Markets Group. The following quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-ups, markdowns, or commissions, and do not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nHolders of Record\nAs of March 3, 2021, the Company had approximately 643 shareholders of record of its common stock, $0.001 par value. The Company has not issued any preferred stock.\nPenny Stock Regulations\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a market price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.\nThe broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.\nThese disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling our securities.\nDividend Policy\nWe currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the execution of our acquisition strategy and the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, if at all. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\nPurchases of Equity Securities By The Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\nRecent Sale of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nPurchase of Our Equity by Officers and Directors\nNone.\nOther Information\nThe Company's shares are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6 promulgated thereunder, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.\nITEM 6.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\nOverview\nRidgefield Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Ridgefield” or the “Company”) was originally incorporated as a Colorado corporation on October 13, 1983 under the name Ozo Diversified, Inc.

The Company is a “shell company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we earned no revenues.\nOur principal executive office is located at 3250 Retail Drive, Suite 120-518, Carson City, NV 89706-0686 and the telephone number is (805) 484-8855. Our website address is www.ridgefieldacquisition.com. None of the information on our website is part of this Form 10-K.\nOutlook\nOur plan of operation is to arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. We have not identified a viable operating entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement, and there can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.\nWe anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity will be a complex process and will involve a number of risks, because potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development.

The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and other factors.\nIn some cases, management of the Company will have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration.

As stated before, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, and there can be no assurance that such a transaction will result in long-term capital appreciation.\nIn connection with its Acquisition Strategy, the Company expects to encounter competition from other entities having business objectives similar to those of the Company. Many of these entities, including venture capital firms, blind pool companies, large industrial and financial institutions, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, are well-established and have extensive experience in connection with identifying and effecting acquisitions directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to compete successfully with such entities. The Company's financial resources will be limited in comparison to those of many of its competitors. The Company's limited financial resources may compel the Company to select certain less attractive acquisition prospects.\nResults of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nRevenues\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company earned no revenues from operations. Overall, the Company incurred a net loss of $68,230 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $55,912 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nBecause the Company’s operations are primarily administrative, the increase in net loss relates entirely to additional interest expense and general and administrative (G&A) expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nG&A expenses consist of professional fees, service charges, office expenses and similar items. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred G&A expenses of $42,057, compared to G&A expenses of $33,255 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $8,802 is largely attributable to increased costs related to compliance and expenses of being a public company. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we saw an increase in compliance costs related to filing SEC forms, as well as other related costs such as legal and audit fees.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent state licenses, filing fees, minimum tax expense and net interest expense. Other expenses increased to $26,155 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $22,657 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase related primarily to interest expense, offset partially by reduced franchise tax expense.\nThe Company incurred net interest expense of $23,450 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 versus $19,054 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Substantially all of this is a result of a loan from the President of the Company. Interest expense increased consistent with the increase in the underlying principal balance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures have been funded from cash balances on hand and loans. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,816 and a working capital deficit of $339,589, which includes short-term indebtedness of $251,161 and related accrued interest of $87,624. Current liabilities also include related party accrued expenses of $2,800, leaving positive working capital of $1,996 when related parties are excluded.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market funds. We did not have any short-term or long-term investments as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company satisfied its working capital needs from related party loans from Steven N. Bronson, the Chairman, President, CEO, and majority shareholder. The note agreement was a Revolving Promissory Note (the “Note”) under which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all outstanding advances shall not exceed $250,000. As of November 1, 2020, the Company and Mr. Bronson amended and restated the Note to allow for borrowings over the $250,000 limit. The Maximum Credit Amount is now increased to $500,000. Borrowings under the Note (plus any accrued interest) bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company borrowed the following amounts under the Note:\nWhile this arrangement will satisfy the Company's immediate financial needs, it may not by itself have the capacity to provide the Company with sufficient capital to finance a merger, acquisition or business combination between the Company and a viable operating entity. The Company may need additional funds in order to complete a merger, acquisition or business combination between the Company and a viable operating entity. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds if and when needed.\nCritical Estimates and Judgments\nThe preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to receivables and accrued expenses. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable based on the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of the Company’s deferred income tax asset valuation allowance. These accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not determinable beyond a “more likely than not” standard, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations. We also utilize a “more likely than not” recognition threshold and measurement analysis for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company does not have any uncertain tax positions. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\nIncome Per Common Share\nBasic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per common share is calculated by adjusting outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive convertible equity instruments consisting of options. There is no difference in the calculation of basic and diluted income per share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had no cash equivalents.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company has an accumulated deficit balance as of December 31, 2020 and net loss during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of this filing, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable. The Company is continually analyzing its current costs and is attempting to make additional cost reductions where possible. We expect that we will continue to generate losses from operations throughout 2021.\nIn order to continue as a going concern and to develop a reliable source of revenues and achieve a profitable level of operations the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through borrowing and/or sales of equity and debt securities. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.\nEconomy and Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our Company’s results of operations.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China and caused significant disruptions to its economy, it has now spread to most other countries and a high number of infections have been reported globally. While we do not expect the coronavirus to impact our operations, it could impact our acquisition strategy, positively or negatively. The extent to which new opportunities are presented to us will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nOff-Balance-Sheet and Contractual Obligations\nOur liquidity is not dependent on the use of off-balance-sheet financing arrangements.\nITEM 7A.",

AND SUBSIDIARY\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nRidgefield Acquisition Corp\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. and its subsidiary (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Matter\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ MaloneBailey, LLP\nwww.malonebailey.com\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nHouston, Texas\nMarch 3, 2021\nPART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 - THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nRidgefield Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Ridgefield” or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on October 13, 1983. Effective June 23, 2006, the Company was reincorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada through the merger of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Since July 2000, the Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters.\nThe Company has no principal operations or revenue producing activities. The Company is now pursuing an acquisition strategy whereby it is seeking to arrange for a merger, acquisition or other business combination with a viable operating entity.\nGOING CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had a working capital deficit and an accumulated deficit. The Company has continued to sustain losses from operations. In addition, the Company has not generated positive cash flow from operations. Management is aware that its current cash resources are not adequate to fund its operations for the following year. The Company cannot provide any assurances as to if and when it will be able to attain profitability. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue operations as a going concern. No adjustment has been made in the consolidated financial statements to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, which could result, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through debt or the placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan or merge with an operating company. The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nThe accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not determinable beyond a “more likely than not” standard, we establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period, we include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations. We also utilize a “more likely than not” recognition threshold and measurement analysis for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company does not have any uncertain tax positions. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\nINCOME PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per common share is calculated by adjusting outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive convertible equity instruments consisting of options. There is no difference in the calculation of basic and diluted income per share for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRIDGEFIELD ACQUISITION CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- continued\nCASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no cash equivalents.\nRELATED PARTIES\nThe Company defines a related person as any director, executive officer, nominee for director, or greater than 5% beneficial owner of our common stock, in each case since the beginning of the most recently completed year, and any of their immediate family members. Transactions with related parties are conducted on terms equivalent to those prevailing in arm’s-length transactions with unrelated parties.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, warranty reserves, inventory valuation reserves, stock-based compensation, purchased intangible asset valuations and useful lives, asset retirement obligations, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. These estimates and assumptions are based on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results we experience may differ materially and adversely from our original estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.\nRISK AND UNCERTAINTIES\nOur future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could affect our business or future results and cause actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not limited to, the ability to raise additional capital, complying with the requirements of being a public company, and our ability to execute our acquisition strategy.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, which replaces the existing guidance in ASC Topic 840, “Leases”. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years and requires retrospective application. The Company did not have any significant lease contracts and there was no impact of ASU 2016-02 to its consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business”, clarifying the definition of a business, reducing the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated and providing a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present. The amendments in the ASU specify that when the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The guidance also requires that an integrated set of assets and activities must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output to be considered a business, and removes the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace the missing elements. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The was no impact on our consolidated financial statements from the application of this accounting standard.\nWe reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded they are not applicable or not expected to be material to our financial statements.\nRIDGEFIELD ACQUISITION CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- continued\nNOTE 2 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company previously occupied a portion of the offices leased by BKF Capital Group, Inc., on a month to month basis for a rental fee of $50 per month that was intended to cover administrative costs. Steven N. Bronson, the Company's Chairman, CEO, and majority shareholder, is also the Chairman, CEO and majority shareholder of BKF Capital Group, Inc. Effective June 30, 2019, the Company terminated this arrangement with BKF Capital Group, Inc., and leased an administrative office from an unrelated party on a month-to-month basis for a minimum of $10 per month. Additional charges, if any, are based upon services provided by the lessor.\nAt both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we owed BKF $2,800 for this previous arrangement. There were no payments made to BKF during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nSteven N. Bronson, the Company's Chairman, President, CEO, and majority shareholder has loaned the Company money to fund working capital needs to pay operating expenses. The loans are repayable upon demand and accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum and are unsecured. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company borrowed the following amounts under the Note:\nNOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES\nIncome tax provision (benefit) consists of the following for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nRIDGEFIELD ACQUISITION CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- continued\nA reconciliation of the income tax provision (benefit) by applying the statutory United States federal income tax rate to net income before income tax provision (benefit) is as follows:\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities, consist of the following:\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company has a federal net operating loss carry-forward of $754,402 available to offset future federal taxable income. The Company’s remaining federal net operating loss carry-forward will expire between 2020 and 2037, with the exception of $125,564 which may be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to ownership changes under applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company has a state net operating loss carry-forward in California of $411,357 available to offset future state taxable income in that state. The Company’s remaining California net operating loss carry-forward will expire between 2028 and 2040. Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to ownership changes under applicable sections of the California Revenue and Taxation Code.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company also has a state net operating loss carry-forward in Florida of $416,892 available to offset future state taxable income in that state. The Company’s remaining Florida net operating loss carry-forward will expire between 2021 and 2033. Utilization of future net operating losses may be limited due to ownership changes under applicable sections of the Florida Income Tax Code. Because the Company no longer has taxable nexus in Florida, we do not expect to have taxable income there in the future. As a result, the Company permanently wrote-off the related deferred tax assets. However, since the Company maintained a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets, this write-off had no impact on tax expense.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, cumulative losses, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020. The valuation allowance at December 31, 2020 was $208,493, an increase of $12,722 from December 31, 2019 when the balance was $195,771.\nRIDGEFIELD ACQUISITION CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- continued\nUnder GAAP, we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nU.S. federal income tax returns after 2016 remain open to examination. Generally, state income tax returns after 2014 remain open to examination. No income tax returns are currently under examination. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits, and continues to monitor its current and prior tax positions for any changes. The Company recognizes penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no penalties or interest recorded in income tax expense.\nITEM 9.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, the Company recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we necessarily are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures.\nEvaluation of disclosure and controls and procedures\nBased on his evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K the Company's principal executive officer has concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to two identified material weaknesses: a) we lack an audit committee and b) we have limited or no segregation of duties.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nInternal control over financial reporting is defined, under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer;\n2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and\n3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThe Company's principal executive officer has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, the Company's principal executive officer was guided by the releases issued by the SEC and to the extent applicable the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's principal executive officer has concluded that based on his assessment, as of December 31, 2020, the Company's procedures of internal control over financial reporting were not effective due to two identified material weaknesses: a) we lack an audit committee and b) we have limited or no segregation of duties. Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity to implement internal control procedures that segregate accounting duties and responsibilities is limited. Until such time as the organization can increase sufficiently in size to warrant an increase in personnel required to effectively execute and monitor formal internal control procedures, those formal procedures will not be implemented.\nReaders are cautioned that internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to the financial statement preparation and presentation.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm, as the Company is a smaller reporting company that is only required to provide management's report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.",
