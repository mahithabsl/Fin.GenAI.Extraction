  "section_1": "Item 1.Business\nOrganization\nBCTC V Assignor Corp., a Delaware corporation, is the assignor limited partner (the “Assignor Limited Partner”) of BF Garden Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (formerly known as Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P.), a Delaware limited partnership (the \"Fund\") and does not engage in any other business. Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the Assignor Limited Partner have been assigned by the Assignor Limited Partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates (“BACs”) to investors and investors are entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund, including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.\nEffective as of December 15, 2020, BF Garden Companion Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership formerly known as Boston Capital Companion Limited Partnership (“Companion”) replaced John P. Manning as the sole owner of the Assignor Limited Partner. Also effective as of December 15, 2020, BFBC Holdings GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of Boston Financial Investment Management, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“BFIM”),replaced Boston Capital Partners II Corporation as the general partner of Companion, and BFIM replaced Boston Capital Companion Holdings Limited Partnership as the sole limited partner of Companion.\nA Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, (the \"Prospectus\") were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering (\"Offering\") in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC. On August 10, 2004 an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective. As of December 31, 2020, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.\nDescription of Business\nThe Assignor Limited Partner’s sole purpose is to act as a conduit through which all of the economic and tax benefits of an investment in the Fund are passed along to the investor BAC holders. The Assignor Limited Partner does not charge any fees for its services and has no income.\nThe Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the \"Operating Partnerships\") each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund will invest will own apartment complexes which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the \"Federal Housing Tax Credit\"), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the \"Rehabilitation Tax Credit\"). Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by The Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving rent supplements from HUD. HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals. At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of the apartment complex.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Fund had invested in 5 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47, 2 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48, and 21 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.\nThe business objectives of the Fund are to:\n(1) provide current tax benefits to investors in the form of Federal Housing Tax Credits and in, limited instances, a small amount of Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which an investor may apply, subject to strict limitations, against the investor's federal income tax liability from active, portfolio and passive income;\n(2) preserve and protect the Fund's capital and provide capital appreciation and cash distributions through increases in value of the Fund's investments and, to the extent applicable, equity buildup through periodic payments on the mortgage indebtedness with respect to the apartment complexes;\n(3) provide tax benefits in the form of passive losses which an investor may apply to offset his passive income (if any); and\n(4) provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in various non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds. The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value. The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.\nEmployees\nThe Assignor Limited Partner does not have any employees and does not perform any services.\nItem 2.",

  "section_9A": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Assignor Limited Partner, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner's \"disclosure controls and procedures\" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Assignor Limited Partner's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Assignor Limited Partner's disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Assignor Limited Partner required to be included in the Assignor Limited Partner's periodic SEC filings.\n(b) Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Assignor Limited Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Assignor Limited Partner's internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Assignor Limited Partner's management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nDue to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nAs required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded the Assignor Limited Partner’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.\nPART III\nItem 10.",
