  "section_7": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following MD&A should be read in conjunction with our annual Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. MD&A contains forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nServiceSource is a leading provider of BPaaS solutions that enable the transformation of go-to-market organizations and functions for global technology clients. We design, deploy, and operate a suite of innovative solutions and complex processes that support and augment our clients’ B2B customer acquisition, engagement, expansion and retention activities. Our clients - ranging from Fortune 500 technology titans to high-growth disruptors and innovators - rely on our holistic customer engagement methodology and process excellence, global scale and delivery footprint, and data analytics and business insights to deliver trusted business outcomes that have a meaningful and material positive impact to their long-term revenue and profitability objectives. Through our unique integration of people, process and technology - leveraged against our more than 20 years of experience and domain expertise in the cloud, software, hardware, medical device and diagnostic equipment, and industrial IoT sectors - we effect and transact billions of dollars of B2B commerce in more than 175 countries on our clients’ behalf annually.\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients. The loss of revenue from any of our top clients for any reason, including the failure to renew our contracts, termination of some or all of our services, or a change of relationship with any of our key clients or their acquisition, may cause a significant decrease in our revenue.\nOur business is geographically diversified. During 2020, 57% of our net revenue was earned in NALA, 28% in EMEA and 15% in APJ, compared to 58% in NALA, 26% in EMEA and 16% in APJ during 2019. All of NALA's revenue represents revenue generated within the U.S. Net revenue for a particular geography generally reflects commissions earned from sales of service contracts managed from our revenue delivery center in that geography. Predominantly all of the service contracts sold and managed by our revenue delivery centers relate to end customers located in the same geography.\nSales Cycle. We sell our integrated solution through our sales organization. At the beginning of the sales process, our quota-carrying sales representatives contact prospective clients and educate them about our offerings. Educating prospective clients about the benefits of our solutions can take time, as many of these prospects have not historically relied upon integrated solutions like ours for service revenue management, nor have they typically put out a formal request for proposal or otherwise made a decision to focus on this area. As part of our sales process, our solutions design team performs a service performance analysis of our prospect’s service revenue. This includes an analysis of best practices and benchmarks the prospect’s service revenue against industry peers. Through this process, which typically takes several weeks, we are able to assess the characteristics and size of the prospect’s service revenue, identify potential areas of performance improvement, and formulate our proposal for managing the prospect’s service revenue. The length of our sales cycle for a new client, inclusive of the service performance analysis process and measured from our first formal discussion with the client until execution of a new client contract, is typically six months and has decreased in recent periods.\nImplementation Cycle. After entering into an engagement with a new client, and to a lesser extent after adding an engagement with an existing client, we incur sales and marketing expenses related to the commissions owed to our sales personnel. These commissions are based on realized revenue that the contract delivers over time and on the estimated total annual contract value. Commission amounts based on realized revenue are expensed in the period the related revenue is recognized by the Company. Upfront commissions based on estimated total annual contract value are capitalizable as contract acquisition costs and expensed ratably over the expected life of the applicable contract or five years if the contract is between the Company and one of its long-standing clients. We also make upfront investments in technology and personnel to support the engagement. These upfront commissions and investments are typically incurred one to three months before we begin generating sales and recognizing revenue. Accordingly, in a given quarter, an increase in new clients, and, to a lesser extent, an increase in engagements with existing clients, or a significant increase in the contract value associated with such new clients and engagements, will negatively impact our gross margin and operating margins until we begin to achieve anticipated sales levels associated with the new engagements, which is typically two to three quarters after we begin selling contracts on behalf of our clients.\nAlthough we expect new client engagements to contribute to our operating profitability over time, in the initial periods of a client relationship, our near-term profitability can be negatively impacted by slower-than anticipated growth in revenues for these engagements as well as the impact of the upfront costs we incur, the lower initial level of associated service sales team productivity and lack of mature data and technology integration with the client. As a result, an increase in the mix of new\nclients as a percentage of total clients may initially have a negative impact on our operating results. Similarly, a decline in the ratio of new clients to total clients may positively impact our near-term operating results.\nContract Terms. A significant portion of our revenue comes from our pay-for-performance model. Under our pay-for-performance model, we earn commissions based on the value of service contracts we sell on behalf of our clients. In some cases, we earn additional performance-based commissions for exceeding pre-determined service performance targets.\nOur new client contracts typically have an initial term between one and two years. Our contracts generally require our clients to deliver a minimum value of qualifying service revenue contracts for us to renew on their behalf during a specified period. To the extent that our clients do not meet their minimum contractual commitments over a specified period, they may be subject to fees for the shortfall. Our client contracts are cancelable with relatively short notice and can be subject to the payment of an early termination fee by the client. The amount of this fee is based on the length of the remaining term and value of the contract.\nMerger and Acquisition Activity. Our clients, particularly those in the technology sector, participate in an active environment for mergers and acquisitions. Large technology companies have maintained active acquisition programs to increase the breadth and depth of their product and service offerings and small and mid-sized companies have combined to better compete with large technology companies. A number of our clients have merged, purchased other companies or been acquired by other companies. We expect merger and acquisition activity to continue to occur in the future.\nThe impact of these transactions on our business can vary. Acquisitions of other companies by our clients can provide us with the opportunity to pursue additional business to the extent the acquired company is not already one of our clients. Similarly, when a client is acquired, we may be able to use our relationship with the acquired company to build a relationship with the acquirer. In some cases, we have been able to maintain our relationship with an acquired client even where the acquiring company handles its other service contract renewals through internal resources. In other cases, however, acquirers have elected to terminate or not renew our contract with the acquired company.\nSeasonality. We experience a seasonal variance in our revenue which is typically higher in the fourth quarter when many of our clients’ products come up for renewal, and for the third quarter of the year which is typically lower as a result of lower or flat renewal volume corresponding to the timing of our customers’ product sales particularly in the international regions. The impact of this seasonal fluctuation can be amplified if the economy as a whole is experiencing disruption or uncertainty, leading to deferral of some renewal decisions.\nForeign currency. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound, Singapore Dollar, Philippine Peso, Bulgarian Lev and Malaysian Ringgit. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency hedging contracts, but may consider entering into such contracts in the future. We believe our operating activities act as a natural hedge for a substantial portion of our foreign currency exposure because we typically collect revenue and incur costs in the currency in the location in which we provide our solution from our revenue delivery centers. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to managing our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. See Item.1A. \"Risk Factors\" for a description of the risks associated with fluctuations of the foreign currency exchange rate in our foreign operations.\nInflation. We do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. With the global outbreak of COVID-19 and the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, we created a dedicated crisis team to proactively implement our business continuity plans. By March 19, 2020, more than 95% of our employees had moved from an in-office to a work-from-home environment and as of April 1, 2020, we transitioned to a 100% virtual operating model. As a result of this successful work-from-home implementation, we have shifted to a virtual-first operating model whereby our employees will continue to primarily work from their home offices and our facilities will be used for collaboration, innovation, and connection. Additionally, this model includes virtual sourcing, hiring, and onboarding for new employees as well as a process for driving performance and culture in a virtual environment. As a result of the implementation of these business continuity measures, we have not experienced material disruptions in our operations.\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity on hand to continue business operations during this volatile period. As of December 31, 2020, we had total available liquidity of $45.2 million consisting of cash on hand and availability under our Revolver. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information.\nThere was no material adverse impact on the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from COVID-19. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic such as costs for enhanced cleaning of our facilities, investing capital to allow our employees to function in our virtual, work-from-home\noperating model and increased paid time off costs resulting from employees taking less paid time off. However, we are benefiting and will continue to benefit from decreases in certain costs related to our facilities and reduced travel and entertainment costs with our virtual-first operating model. We do not currently anticipate that these items will have a material adverse impact on our overall business and financial results.\nDuring 2020, ServiceSource received various grants from the Singapore government, including the Job Support Scheme, which assists enterprises in retaining their local employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. ServiceSource received approximately $1.3 million from the grant during the year ended December 31, 2020 and is expected to receive an additional $0.2 million through July 2021.There are no conditions to repay the grants.\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations increases the longer the virus impacts the economic activity in the U.S. and globally. See Part I, Item 1A - “Risk Factors” for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nNet Revenue\nSubstantially all of our net revenue is attributable to commissions we earn from the sale of renewals of maintenance, support and subscription agreements on behalf of our clients. We generally invoice our clients for our selling services on a monthly basis for sales commissions, and on a quarterly basis for certain performance sales commissions. We do not set the price, terms or scope of services in the service contracts with end customers and do not have any obligations related to the underlying service contracts between our clients and their end customers. We also generate revenues from selling professional services for which we are the principal. Professional services involve providing data integration at scale with our systems and processes, combined with client data enhancement, enablement and optimization. We typically invoice our clients for professional services on a monthly basis.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of revenue includes employee compensation, technology costs, including those related to the delivery of our cloud-based technologies, and allocated overhead expenses. Employee compensation includes salary, bonus, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our dedicated service sales teams. Allocated overhead expenses include depreciation, amortization of internal-use software associated with our selling services revenue technology platform and cloud applications, and costs for facilities and information technology. Allocated overhead expenses for facilities consist of rent, maintenance, and compensation of personnel in our facilities departments. Our allocated overhead expenses for information technology include costs associated with third-party data centers where we maintain our data servers, compensation of our information technology personnel and the cost of support and maintenance contracts associated with computer hardware and software. To the extent our client base or business with our existing client base expands, we may need to hire additional service sales personnel and invest in infrastructure to support such growth. Our cost of revenue may fluctuate significantly and increase or decrease on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue in the near term, including for the reasons discussed under, “Factors Affecting Our Performance-Implementation Cycle.”\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee compensation expense and sales commissions paid to our sales and marketing employees, amortization of contract acquisition costs, marketing programs and events and allocated overhead expenses which consist of depreciation, amortization of internally developed software, and facility and technology costs. We sell our solutions through our global sales organization, which is organized across three geographic regions: NALA, EMEA and APJ. Our commission plans generally provide multiple payments of commissions to our sales representatives based in part on the execution of a client contract and then on a percentage of revenue recorded during the first one to three years of the contract term. Commissions paid as a percentage of recorded revenue is contingent on the sales representatives' continued employment. We generally capitalize the amounts payable for obtaining a contract and amortize ratably to sales and marketing expense over the contract term for new clients or five years for long-standing client relationships. Revenue based commissions are generally expensed to sales and marketing expense each quarter as revenue is recorded.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation expense, third-party consultant costs and allocated overhead expenses which consist of depreciation, amortization of internally developed software, and facility and technology costs. We focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and applications related to our technology platform. We capitalize certain expenditures related to the development and enhancement of internal-use software related to our technology platform.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation expense for our executive, human resources, finance and legal functions and expenses for professional fees for accounting, tax and legal services, as well as allocated overhead expenses, which consist of depreciation, amortization of internally developed software, facility and technology costs.\nRestructuring and Other Related Costs\nRestructuring and other related costs primarily consist of employee severance payments and related benefits and legal fees and charges related to lease termination costs. During 2019 and 2020, the Company announced restructuring efforts resulting in a reduction of headcount and office lease costs. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to the 2019 restructuring effort and expects to incur additional costs through 2021 related to the 2020 restructuring effort.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net consists of interest expense associated with our Revolver, imputed interest from finance lease payments, interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, amortization of debt issuance costs and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nProvision for Income Tax Expense\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of our taxable subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis. This evaluation utilizes the framework contained in ASC 740 wherein management analyzes all positive and negative evidence available at the balance sheet date to determine whether all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Under this guidance, a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50 percent) that they will not be realized. In assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and place significant emphasis on guidance contained in ASC 740, which states that “a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.”\nWe account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an income tax liability, if any, for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions change, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.\nKey Financial Results - Full Year Ended December 31, 2020\n•GAAP revenue was $194.6 million, compared with $216.1 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•GAAP net loss was $18.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with GAAP net loss of $18.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $4.3 million compared with $4.2 million reported for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Income tax expense increased $0.3 million, or 60%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, due to an increase in profitable operations in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary operating cash requirements include the payment of compensation and related employee costs and costs for our facilities and information technology infrastructure. Historically, we have financed our operations from cash provided by our operating activities. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next twelve months.\nWe have considered the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including customer purchasing and renewal decisions in our assessment of the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources. We will continue to monitor our financial position as pandemic-related challenges develop over time.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $34.0 million, which primarily consist of demand deposits and money market mutual funds. Included in cash and cash equivalents was $6.7 million held by our foreign subsidiaries used to satisfy their operating requirements. We consider the undistributed earnings of ServiceSource Europe Ltd. and ServiceSource International Singapore Pte. Ltd. permanently reinvested in foreign operations and have not provided for U.S. income taxes on such earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no unremitted earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.\nIn July 2018, the Company entered into a $40.0 million Revolver that allows it and the other Borrowers named therein to borrow against its domestic receivables as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Revolver matures July 2021 and bears interest at a variable rate per annum based on the greater of the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% or the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus, in each case, a margin of 1.00% for base rate borrowings or 2.00% for Eurodollar borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $15.0 million of borrowings under the Revolver through a one-month Eurodollar borrowing at an effective interest rate of 2.15% maturing January 2021. An additional $11.2 million was available for borrowing under the Revolver as of December 31, 2020. The Eurodollar borrowings may be extended upon maturity, converted into a base rate borrowing upon maturity or require an incremental payment if the Company's borrowing base decreases below the current amount outstanding during the term of the Eurodollar borrowing.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the one-month $15.0 million Eurodollar borrowing was extended at an effective interest rate of approximately 2.12% maturing at the end of February 2021.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Borrowers and certain of their subsidiaries, including pledges of equity in certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Revolver has financial covenants which the Company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLetters of Credit and Restricted Cash\nIn connection with two of our leased facilities, the Company is required to maintain two letters of credit totaling $2.3 million. The letters of credit are secured by $2.3 million of cash in money market accounts, which are classified as restricted cash in \"Other assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows:\nDepreciation and amortization expense were comprised of the following:\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $12.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of decreased revenue and higher supplier payments during the current period compared to the prior period related to operating costs accrued for previously.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, due to decreased cash outflows from purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $15.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily as a result of $15.0 million in net cash inflows from borrowings on the Revolver during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any relationships with other entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose entities, which have been established for facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are based on historical experiences that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. From time to time, we re-evaluate those estimates and assumptions.\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” These policies were followed in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies. These accounting policies have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and/or complex estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenues primarily from selling and professional services. Revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606 when performance obligations identified in a contract are satisfied, which is achieved through the transfer of control of the services to our client.\nSelling Services\nSelling services primarily consist of variable fees earned from the following categories of selling motions: (1) digital sales, (2) customer success, and (3) channel management.\nProfessional Services\nProfessional services primarily consist of fixed fees for providing data integration at scale with our systems and processes, combined with client data enhancement, enablement and optimization. Professional services revenues from fixed consideration are recognized based on proportional performance over the performance period which is typically concluded within 90 days of contract execution.\nMultiple Arrangements\nThe Company enters into contracts with multiple performance obligations that incorporate fixed consideration, pay-for-performance commissions and variable bonus commissions. Judgment is required to estimate the amount of variable consideration to include when estimating the total contract consideration and how to allocate the consideration if one of the distinct performance obligations is not sold at SSP.\nPerformance Obligations\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract. Individual services within a single contract are accounted separately if they are distinct. The total contract consideration, or transaction price, is allocated between the separate services identified in the contract based on their SSP. SSP is determined based on a cost plus margin analysis for selling\nservices and a standard hourly rate card for professional services. For professional services that are contractually priced differently from SSP, the Company estimates SSP using a standard hourly rate card and allocates a portion of the total contract consideration to reflect professional services revenue at SSP.\nThe Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time and revenue is recognized based on monthly or quarterly time increments and the variable volume of closed bookings during the period at the contractual commission rates for selling services, or proportional performance during the period at SSP for professional services. Because the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the Company’s selling services as provided, the time increment output method depicts the measure of progress in transferring control of the services to the client.\nWhile multiple selling motions in a contract are performed at various times and patterns throughout the month or quarter and the number of closed bookings vary in any given period, each time increment of a service activity is substantially the same and has the same pattern of transfer to the client, and therefore, represents a series of distinct performance obligations that form a single performance obligation. As a result, the Company allocates all variable consideration in a contract to the selling services performance obligation in accordance with the variable consideration allocation exception provisions in ASC 606 (less amounts for which it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur when the uncertainties related to the variability are resolved) and applies a single measure of progress to record revenue in the period based on when the output of the variable number of closed bookings occurs or when the variable performance metric is achieved.\nOur revenue contracts often include promises to transfer services involving multiple selling motions to a client. Determining whether those services are considered distinct performance obligations and qualify as a series of distinct performance obligations that represent a single performance obligation requires significant judgment. Also, due to the continuous nature of providing services to our clients, judgment is required in determining when control of the services is transferred to the client.\nA significant portion of our contracts is based on a pay-for-performance model that provides the Company with commissions and revenue based on a volume of closed bookings each time period and variable consideration if certain performance targets are achieved during a given period of time (such as exceeding quarterly closure rate thresholds or achieving absolute dollar volume sales targets). Significant judgment is required to determine if this type of variable consideration should be constrained, and to what extent, until the risk of a significant revenue reversal is not probable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. PSU compensation expense is only recorded if it is probable the performance conditions will be met.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for possible impairment at least annually or if indicators of impairment arise, such as significant changes in key factors including the industry and competitive environment, stock price, actual revenue performance year over year, EBITDA and cash flow generation that would more-likely-than-not indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit which include estimating future cash flows. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit which could trigger impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of our taxable subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.\nWe regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In making that assessment, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine, based on the weight of available evidence, whether it is more-likely-than-not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Examples of positive and negative evidence include future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we\nlater determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time.\nWe account for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We record an income tax liability, if any, for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. To the extent that the assessment of such tax positions change, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and the anticipated impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measurements\nServiceSource believes net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate financial measure of our operating performance; however, ServiceSource considers Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental, non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA can assist investors in understanding and assessing our operating performance on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of the Company's capital structure and other non-cash or non-recurring items from operating results and provides an additional tool to compare ServiceSource's financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\nEBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus provision for income tax expense (benefit), interest and other expense (income), net and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA plus stock-based compensation, restructuring and other related costs, amortization of contract acquisition costs related to the initial adoption of ASC 606 and costs attributable to establishing a litigation reserve.\nThis non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of \"Net loss\" to Adjusted EBITDA:\nITEM 7A.",

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe CEO manages and allocates resources on a company-wide basis as a single segment that is focused on service offerings which integrate data, processes and cloud technologies.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amount of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nThe Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Company has considered the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in determining its estimates. However, future events are difficult to predict and subject to change, especially with the risks and uncertainties related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause estimates and judgments to require adjustment. Actual results and outcomes may differ from our estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain items on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not affect the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss or Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.\nSignificant Risks and Uncertainties\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company is also exposed to market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nCash is maintained in demand deposit accounts at U.S., European and Asian financial institutions that management believes are credit worthy. Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on these deposits.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value guidance establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. An asset or liability’s level is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable;\nLevel 3: Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe carrying amount of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nCash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are classified as a Level 1 investment.\nRestricted cash consists of cash in money market accounts that are used to secure letters of credit in connection with two of our leased facilities. Restricted cash is recorded within \"Other assets\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is classified as a Level 1 investment. The Company had restricted cash of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Net revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average exchange rates. The Company accumulates net translation adjustments in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. For non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar, transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured in U.S. dollars, and any resulting gains and losses are reported in \"Interest and other expense, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency transaction losses were approximately $0.9 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are derived from services performed for clients located primarily in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The Company attempts to mitigate the credit risk in its trade receivables through its ongoing credit evaluation process and historical collection experience. The Company performs a periodic review for specific aging evaluation allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of its accounts receivable, which takes into consideration an analysis of historical bad debts, customers' timeliness on payment and other available information.\nAccounts receivable are stated at their carrying values net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, if applicable. The Company evaluates the ongoing collectability of its accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as the credit quality of its clients, the age of accounts receivable balances, collections experience, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect a client’s ability to pay. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific client’s inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount that management believes will ultimately be collected. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and recoveries and reductions to revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were insignificant.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe Company records property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives for each asset class.\nWhen assets are disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are written-off and any gain or loss on sale or disposal is reported in \"General and administrative\" expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLease Asset Retirement Obligations\nThe fair value of a liability for an ARO is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The Company’s AROs are associated with leasehold improvements at our international office locations, which, at the end of a lease, are contractually obligated to be removed. AROs were approximately $1.5 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accretion expense was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCapitalized Internal-Use Software\nExpenditures related to software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a period of two to seven years on a straight-line basis. The Company capitalizes direct external costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees or professional fees for consultants who are directly associated with the development of such applications. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred and are recorded in \"Research and development\" expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software under development are treated as construction-in-progress until the program, feature or functionality is ready for its intended use, at which time amortization commences.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net identifiable assets of acquired businesses. The Company evaluates goodwill for possible impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. This evaluation includes a preliminary assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If there are indicators of impairment, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded. The carrying value of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $6.3 million. No impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived asset is impaired, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. No impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nComprehensive Loss\nWe report comprehensive loss in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Amounts reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” consist of foreign currency translation adjustments from subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company provides a comprehensive suite of selling and professional services to its clients.\nSelling services consists of sales earned from the following categories of selling motions:\n•Digital sales activities include demand qualification, demand conversion, and account management;\n•Customer success activities include onboarding, adoption, and renewals management; and\n•Channel management efforts include partner recruitment, partner onboarding and enablement, and partner success management.\nProfessional services involve providing data integration at scale with our systems and processes, combined with client data enhancement, enablement and optimization.\nThe Company derives all of its revenue from contracts with clients. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract. The Company’s contracts generally contain one to two distinct performance obligations that are sold on a variable and/or fixed consideration basis. These two distinct performance obligations are identified as selling services and professional services. Selling services are generally invoiced on a monthly or quarterly basis with standard 30-day payment terms over the length of the contract, typically one to three years. Professional services are generally invoiced upfront upon obtaining a client contract and are typically fulfilled within 90 days.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies the performance obligations identified in the contract, which is achieved through the transfer of control of the services to the client. The timing of satisfying performance obligations and the receipt of client consideration can be different and will give rise to contract assets and contract liabilities. Contract assets relate to the Company’s conditional rights to consideration for services provided but not yet billable at the reporting date. Accounts receivable balances reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent the Company’s unconditional rights to consideration for services provided. Contract asset amounts are transferred to accounts receivables when the rights become unconditional, typically in the same period control of services is transferred to the client and the amount is contractually billable. Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from clients for fixed consideration contracts where transfer of control of the services has not yet occurred. Contract liability balances generally convert to revenue upon either the satisfaction of professional services obligations or when services under fixed consideration contracts are transferred to the client, typically within six months of being recorded. These contract balances are reflected in \"Prepaid expenses and other\", \"Other assets\" and \"Other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company accounts for individual services within a single contract separately if they are distinct. A service is distinct if it is separately identifiable from other services in the contract and if a client can benefit from the service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the client. Determining whether these services are considered distinct performance obligations and qualify as a series of distinct performance obligations that represent a single performance obligation requires significant judgment. The total contract consideration, or transaction price, is allocated between the separate services identified in the contract based on their SSP. SSP is determined based on a cost-plus margin analysis for selling services and a standard hourly rate card for professional services. For professional services that are contractually priced differently from SSP, the Company estimates the SSP using a standard hourly rate card and allocates a portion of the total contract consideration to reflect professional services revenue at SSP.\nThe Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time and revenue is recognized based on monthly or quarterly time increments and the variable volume of closed bookings during the period at the contractual commission rates for selling services, or proportional performance during the period at SSP for professional services. Due to the continuous nature of providing services to our clients, judgment is required in determining when control of the services is transferred to the client. Because the client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the Company’s selling and professional services as provided, the time increment output method depicts the measure of progress in transferring control of the services to the client. A significant portion of the Company’s contracts is based on a pay-for-performance model in which commission revenue is based on a volume of closed bookings each time period. At each reporting period, the Company makes an estimate of this revenue for amounts that have yet to be invoiced, which was $16.3 million and $16.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These accrued revenue balances are reflected in \"Accounts Receivable” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWhile multiple selling motions in a contract are performed at various times and patterns throughout the month or quarter and the number of closed bookings vary in any given period, each time increment of a service activity is substantially the same and has the same pattern of transfer to the client, and therefore, represents a series of distinct performance obligations that form a single performance obligation. As a result, the Company allocates all variable consideration in a contract to the selling services performance obligation in accordance with the variable consideration allocation exception provisions in ASC 606, (less amounts for which it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur when the uncertainties related to the variability are resolved) and applies a single measure of progress to record revenue in the period based on when the output of the variable number of closed bookings occurs or when the variable performance metric is achieved. Judgment is required to estimate the amount of variable consideration to include when estimating the total contract consideration and how to allocate the consideration if one of the distinct performance obligations is not sold at SSP. In addition, judgment is required to determine if the variable consideration should be constrained, and to what extent, until the risk of a significant revenue reversal is not probable. The Company applies the optional disclosure exemptions related to variable consideration and the requirement to disclose the remaining transaction price allocated to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation.\nSignificant estimates and judgments for revenue recognition include: (1) identifying and determining distinct performance obligations in contracts with clients, (2) determining the timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations, (3) estimating the timing and amount of variable consideration in a contract, (4) determining SSP for each performance obligations and the methodology to allocate the total contract consideration to the distinct performance obligations, and (5) determining and measuring variable revenue that has yet to be invoiced as of period end.\nOur revenue contracts often include promises to transfer services involving multiple selling motions to a client. Determining whether those services are considered distinct and qualify as a series of distinct services that represent a single performance obligation requires significant judgment. Also, due to the continuous nature of providing services to our clients, judgment is required in determining when control of the services is transferred to the client.\nWe also enter into contracts with multiple performance obligations that incorporate fixed consideration, pay-for-performance commissions and variable bonus commissions. Judgment is required to estimate the amount of variable consideration to include when estimating the total contract consideration and how to allocate the consideration if one of the distinct performance obligations is not sold at SSP.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nTo obtain contracts with clients, the Company pays its sales team commissions partly based on the estimated value of the contract. Because these sales commissions are incurred and paid upon contract execution and would not have been incurred or payable otherwise, they are considered incremental costs to acquire the contract; and if recoverable, are capitalized as contract acquisition costs in the period the contract is executed. Capitalized sales commissions are amortized to “Sales and marketing\" expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the transfer of services over the contract term, generally one to three years for a new client or five years for long-standing client relationships. The contract acquisition costs asset is evaluated for recoverability and impairment each reporting period. For initial amortization periods one year or less, the Company recognizes any incremental costs of obtaining contracts as expense when the cost is incurred. These costs are included in \"Sales and marketing\" expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues stock-based awards to employees and directors and offered an ESPP until its expiration in February 2021.\nStock options are recorded at fair value on the date of grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and generally vest ratably over a three to four-year period. Vested options may be exercised up to ten years from the grant date, as defined in the 2020 Plan. Vested but unexercised options expire 90 days after termination of employment with the Company. Stock-based compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period during which the right to exercise such options fully vests.\nRSUs are recorded at fair value on the date of grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period during which the stock vests. RSUs generally vest ratably over three to four years with vesting contingent upon employment of the Company.\nPSUs are stock-based awards in which the number of shares ultimately received by the employee ranges from 0% to 150% of the participant's target award depending on the Company’s achievement of specified Adjusted EBITDA and net bookings targets. PSU expense is based on a fixed grant date fair value and adjusted based on the estimated achievement of the performance metrics and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the straight-line attribution approach.\nThe fair value of stock options and purchase rights under the ESPP was determined by the Company using the methods and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.\nExpected Term - The expected term represents the period that the Company’s share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The Company calculates the expected term based on the average of the weighted-average vesting term and contractual term.\nExpected Volatility - The expected volatility is based on the historical stock volatility of the Company's own common shares.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues for each option grant date with maturities approximately equal to the option’s contractual term.\nExpected Dividend Yield - The Company has not paid dividends on its common shares nor does it expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSee \"Note 7 - Stock-Based Compensation\" for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and the financial reporting basis of our taxable subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. These audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal, state, local and foreign tax laws. The Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits using a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company records an income tax liability, if any, for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax returns. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.\nNet Loss Per Common Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased under the Company’s ESPP, non-vested RSUs and PSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company’s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities.\nPotential shares of common stock that are not included in the determination of diluted net income per share because they are anti-dilutive for the periods presented consist of stock options, non-vested RSUs and PSUs, and shares to be purchased under our ESPP.\nThe Company excluded from diluted earnings per share the weighted-average common share equivalents related to 3.3 million and 7.3 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nGovernment Assistance\nDuring 2020, ServiceSource received various grants from the Singapore government, including the Job Support Scheme, which assists enterprises in retaining their local employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. ServiceSource received approximately $1.3 million from these grants during the year ended December 31, 2020 and is expected to receive an additional $0.2 million through July 2021. There are no conditions to repay the grants. Government grants are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations during the same period that the expenses related to the grant are incurred if there is reasonable assurance the grant will be received, and the Company has complied with any conditions attached to the grant.\nNew Accounting Standards Issued but Not yet Adopted\nIncome Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued an ASU that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in ASC 740 related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods for those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Based on our current analysis, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2021.\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that amends the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held. This ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods for those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. This standard will apply to the Company's accounts receivable and contract assets. Based on our current analysis, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements as credit losses from trade receivables have historically been insignificant. The Company will adopt this standard effective January 1, 2023.\nNote 3 - Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nProperty and equipment, net were comprised of the following:\n(1) Includes capitalized internally developed software as follows (in thousands):\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment, which includes amortization expense for internally developed software and finance leases, was $13.9 million and $13.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table presents long-lived assets by geographic location:\nNote 4 - Debt\nRevolving Line of Credit\nIn July 2018, the Company entered into a $40.0 million Revolver that allows it and the other Borrower named therein to borrow against their domestic receivables as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Revolver matures July 2021 and bears interest at a variable rate per annum based on the greater of the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% or the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%, plus, in each case, a margin of 1.00% for base rate borrowings or 2.00% for Eurodollar borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $15.0 million of borrowings under the Revolver through a one-month Eurodollar borrowing at an effective interest rate of 2.15% maturing January 2021. An additional $11.2 million was available for borrowing under the Revolver as of December 31, 2020. The Eurodollar borrowings may be extended upon maturity, converted into a base rate borrowing upon maturity or require an incremental payment if the borrowing base decreases below the current amount outstanding during the term of the Eurodollar borrowing.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the one-month $15.0 million Eurodollar borrowing was extended at an effective interest rate of approximately 2.12% maturing at the end of February 2021.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all the assets of the Borrower and certain of their subsidiaries, including pledges of equity in certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Revolver has financial covenants which the Company was in compliance with as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense associated with the Company's debt obligation was $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 5 - Leases\nThe Company has operating leases for office space and finance leases for certain equipment under non-cancelable agreements with various expiration dates through May 2030. Certain office leases include the option to extend the term between one to seven years and certain office leases include the option to terminate the lease upon written notice within one year after lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nDuring 2020, the Company entered into a 22-month sublease agreement with a third-party for one floor of its Manila office space through October 2021, extended its lease for two of its five floors in the Kuala Lumpur office space through December 2023, and extended its lease for one of its three floors in the Sofia office space through February 2026.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company entered into a sublease agreement through the end of the original lease term with a third party for two floors of its Manila office space, with total sublease income of approximately $1.4 million.\nThe Company recognizes rent expense and sublease income on a straight-line basis over the lease period and accrues for rent expense and sublease income incurred but not paid.\nSupplemental income statement information related to leases was as follows:\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nLease term and discount rate information was as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities were as follows as of December 31, 2020:\nNote 6 - Revenue Recognition\nThe following tables present the disaggregation of revenue from contracts with our clients:\nRevenue by Performance Obligation\nRevenue by Geography\nRevenue for each geography generally reflects commissions earned from sales of service contracts managed from revenue delivery centers in that geography and subscription sales and professional services to deploy the Company's solutions.

All NALA revenue represents revenue generated within the U.S.\nRevenue by Contract Pricing\nFour of our clients represented 15%, 15%, 11% and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nAs of December 31, 2020, contract assets and liabilities were $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, contract assets were insignificant and contract liabilities were $0.8 million.\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, assuming none of the Company’s current contracts with fixed consideration are renewed, the Company estimates receiving approximately $35.9 million in future selling services fixed consideration and approximately $0.4 million in professional services fixed consideration.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, capitalized contract acquisition costs were $0.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively.

The 2020 Plan provides for the Company's common stock to be issued pursuant to permitted awards, which include, but are not limited to, options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance stock units and other cash and stock-based awards. As of December 31, 2020, 3.5 million shares were available for grant under the 2020 Plan.\nOn May 14, 2020, following the approval of the 2020 Plan, the Company’s board of directors terminated the 2011 Plan with the effect that no additional awards may be issued under the 2011 Plan and all outstanding awards under the 2011 Plan shall continue and be unaffected by the termination of the 2011 Plan.\n2020 PSU Awards\nDuring May 2020 and prior to expiration of the 2011 Plan, the Company granted PSUs to certain executives under the 2011 Plan. The aggregate target number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 subject to these awards is 0.7 million, with an aggregate grant date fair value of $0.9 million. The number of shares ultimately received related to these awards ranges from 0% to 150% of the executive's target award depending on the Company's achievement of specified Adjusted EBITDA and net bookings targets over a two-year performance period and will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents stock-based compensation expense as allocated within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nThe above table does not include capitalized stock-based compensation related to internal-use software that was insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFair Value of Equity Compensation\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions for stock options were as follows:\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions for purchase rights under the ESPP were as follows:\nStock Awards\nA summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information was as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.\nA summary of the Company's RSU and PSU activity and related information was as follows:\n(1) 1,845 shares of common stock were issued for RSUs and PSUs vested and the remaining 99 shares were withheld for taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $7.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs and PSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.\nNote 8 - Restructuring and Other Related Costs\nThe Company has undergone restructuring efforts to better align its cost structure with its business and market conditions. These restructuring efforts include severance and other employee costs, lease and other contract termination costs and asset impairments. Severance and other employee costs include severance payments, related employee benefits, stock-based compensation related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards and employee-related legal fees. Lease and other contract termination costs include charges related to lease consolidation and abandonment of spaces no longer utilized and the cancellation of certain contracts with outside vendors. Asset impairments include charges related to leasehold improvements and furniture in spaces vacated or no longer in use. The restructuring plans and future cash outlays are recorded in \"Accrued expenses\" and \"Other long-term liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDuring 2020, the Company announced a restructuring effort to align with its virtual-first operating model and reduce the operating cost structure resulting in a reduction of headcount and office lease costs. The Company recognized charges related to this restructuring effort of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and expects to incur approximately $1.0 million in additional costs through 2021.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending fair value liability balance related to the 2020 restructuring effort:\nDuring 2019, the Company announced a restructuring effort resulting in a reduction of headcount and office lease costs. The Company recognized charges related to this restructuring effort of $0.7 million and $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company does not expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to the 2019 restructuring.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending fair value liability balance related to the 2019 restructuring effort:\nIn May 2017, the Company announced a restructuring effort resulting in a headcount reduction and the reduction of office space in four locations. The Company does not expect to incur additional restructuring charges related to the May 2017 restructuring.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending fair value liability balance related to the May 2017 restructuring effort:\nNote 9 - Income Taxes\nLoss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for the Company’s domestic and international operations was as follows:\nThe income tax provision consisted of the following:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of income taxes provided at the federal statutory rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 to the income tax provision:\nIn November 2015, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority granted a four-year tax holiday to the Company's Philippine affiliate, commencing with its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2016. The earnings per share benefit in 2020 and 2019 was not material.The Company has applied for the tax holiday extension, however, as of December 31, 2020 the extension has not been granted. Therefore, the Company included tax on modified gross receipts in the current income tax calculation.\nIn December 2013, Malaysia granted a ten-year tax holiday to the Company’s Malaysia affiliate, commencing with its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2014. This resulted in a tax benefit in fiscal 2013 of approximately $0.2 million from the elimination of the Malaysia subsidiary’s deferred tax liabilities. The earnings per share benefit in 2019 and 2020 was not material.\nThe following table provides the effect of temporary differences that created deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes resulting from temporary differences and carryforwards at the end of the respective periods:\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, management assessed the realizability of deferred tax assets and evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis. This evaluation utilizes the framework contained in ASC 740 wherein management analyzes all positive and negative evidence available at the balance sheet date to determine whether all or some portion of the Company's deferred tax assets will not be realized. Under this guidance, a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that the asset will not be realized. In assessing the realization of the Company's deferred tax assets, management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative.\nIn concluding on the evaluation, management placed significant emphasis on guidance in ASC 740, which states that “a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.” Based upon available evidence, it was concluded on a more-likely-than-not basis that all deferred tax assets were not realizable as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $90.9 million has been recorded to offset this deferred tax asset. The valuation allowance decreased $3.8 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company also maintains a deferred tax liability related to indefinite lived intangible assets in jurisdictions which the Company does not have indefinite lived deferred tax assets, as reversal of the taxable temporary difference cannot serve as a source of income for realization of the non-indefinite deferred tax assets, because the deferred tax liability will not reverse until the asset is sold or written down due to impairment.\nASC 842\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019. Under ASC 842, the Company is required to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from most operating leases on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, no change in retained earnings was recorded related to income taxes as the Company maintains a full valuation allowance. As of the implementation date, an adjustment of $4.6 million was recorded as a deferred tax liability and an adjustment of $4.6 million was recorded as a deferred tax asset.\nOperating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $2.7 million of U.S. federal research and development credits which expire beginning in 2031 and $3.7 million of California research and development credits which do not expire. The Company also has $0.5 million of California Enterprise Zone Credits which expire beginning in 2023 if not utilized and $1.3 million of other state tax credits which expire beginning in 2024 if not utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $316.7 million for federal income tax purposes of which $52.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely and the remaining $264.8 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2024. The Company has $248.6 million in state net operating losses. These losses are available to reduce taxable income and expire at various dates beginning in 2021. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.4 million of which $14.6 million is indefinitely available to reduce taxable income and will expire in 2025.\nUtilization of the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the IRC and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration or elimination of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. Management believes that the limitation will not limit utilization of the carryforwards prior to their expiration.\nThe Company acquired U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of Scout Analytics, Inc. upon the acquisition of that entity in January 2014, subject to the ownership change limitations. Acquired U.S. federal net operating losses from Scout total approximately $30.2 million net of amounts unavailable due to ownership change limitations, which is included in the total U.S. federal net operating loss above.\nThe Company's 2016 through 2020 tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. As the Company has incurred losses in most jurisdictions, the taxing authorities can generally challenge 2006 through 2015 losses to determine either the amount of the carryforward deduction reported in the open year or the amount of an net operating loss deduction that is absorbed in a closed year and supports the determination of the available net operating loss deduction for the open year under examination.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.0 million, none of which, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest and penalties recognized were insignificant.\nNote 10 - Employee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) defined contribution plan that covers eligible employees. Employer matching contributions, which may be discontinued at the Company’s discretion, were approximately $1.3 million and $1.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 11 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLetter of Credit\nIn connection with two of our leased facilities, the Company is required to maintain two letters of credit totaling $2.3 million. The letters of credit are secured by $2.3 million of cash in money market accounts, which are classified as restricted cash in \"Other assets\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-cancelable Service Contract Commitments\nFuture minimum payments under non-cancelable service contract commitments were as follows:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ServiceSource International, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ServiceSource International, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nMeasurement of revenue accruals\nDescription of the MatterAs more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, a significant portion of the Company’s contracts is based on a pay-for-performance model in which commission revenue is based on a volume of closed bookings each time period. Significant judgment is required to estimate such accrued commission revenue at year end for amounts that the Company has not yet invoiced. At December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $16.3 million of accrued commission revenue.\nAuditing accrued commission revenue was subjective and involved significant audit effort due to the amount of the commission revenue accrual and the subjectivity applied in our audit procedures, including the testing of closed bookings which is an underlying assumption of the accrual.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to accrued commission revenue, including management’s review of the completeness and accuracy of data used in the accrual. For example, we tested the Company’s controls over management’s review of the underlying data used in the commission revenue accrual and controls over management’s review of the amounts subsequently invoiced compared to the amounts accrued.\nTo test the Company’s calculation of the commission revenue accrual, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the calculation, and comparing the commission revenue accrual to actual invoices for closed bookings approved subsequent to year end. We also performed analytical procedures by developing expectations of the amount of the commission revenue accrual for which actual invoices have not been approved as of the financial statement issuance date based on historical activity.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nDenver, Colorado\nFebruary 24, 2021\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ServiceSource International, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited ServiceSource International, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, ServiceSource International, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated February 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDenver, Colorado\nFebruary 24, 2021\nITEM 9.",

  "section_9A": "ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on management’s evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2020 our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide at a reasonable assurance level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nITEM 9B.",
